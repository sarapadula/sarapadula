I was able to save the chat logs into a file that saves the date in time. The user has to enter the date and time though because visual studio will not allow me to use the commands "localtime" and "ctime" to figure out the current time without giving me an error. In addition, I was able to get the data needed for this assignment to save in a csv file and I was able to get the chat logs to save in text files in the designated folder, but I cannot extract the data from these files in the way that was needed in the assignment. I have been able to successfully complete all the programming assignments before this, and parsing through comma deliminated files in c++ is not an easy task. I would appreciate thorough feedback on this assignment so I can improve it before the final submission. Thank you.
