For the final part of the project – session logger – I was tasked with calculating and outputting statistics about all chat sessions that occurred in the program. To do this, I used all the same code from my previous projects an added many things necessary to implement this program. Firstly, I added a clock that times the chat session, an int variable that is iterated every time the user chats, and an int variable that is iterated every time the computer chats. I also wrote code that would ask the user to enter the date and time before each chat session and use that information to create a new txt file where the chat log of the chat session would be saved. Additionally, I created a count txt file that would add 1 to the file each time a chat session is begun, so I can then add all the ones within the count file to determine the chat ID of that specific chat session. Then, I created a function create() that takes in user iterations, computer iterations, time (from the clock), the txt filename, and the count file. Then, this function adds a line to an already existing csv file to save the data to later be extracted. Then I created a data structure that would save every chat sessions statistics into an easily accessible format. Then I used these data structures to extract, then calculate the necessary information for the statistics that the user asks about.
